# SystemInfo

## Description

This app provides some useful information about the device in one single place. It is intended to be used primarily by Android developers and testers but can be useful to anybody curious about their device.

## Purpose

I made this program because I was tired of looking in different locations to find different information about a device that I wanted to use to test my apps. I needed to have a quick overview of characteristics of the device such as Android version, screen density, etc. in order to be able to organize my tests properly.

It was also the opportunity to start working with Kotlin instead of Java.

This is an on-going process: more functionalities will be added and more Kotlin stuff will be explored.

## Installation

You can install the app from the source code.
